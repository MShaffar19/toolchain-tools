#######################

In order to ease the development of the **StatisKit** software suite on multiple operating systems, the **Conda** package and environment management system is used.
To insall **Conda** refer to the section :ref:`section-user-install_it-prerequisites`.

Once **Conda** installed, you need to create the development environment called :code:`statiskit-dev` on your machine.
To do so you must type:
  
.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n statiskit-dev statiskit-dev -c statiskit

.. warning::

  On Windows OSes you must first download and install **Visual Studio Community 2013** (available on this `page <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/>`_).

Then, you activate the created environment for each build of **Statiskit** software suite components by following instructions given after the installation.
