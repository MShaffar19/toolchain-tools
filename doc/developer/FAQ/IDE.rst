How to Configure my :abbr:`IDE (Integrated Development Environment)` ?
######################################################################

For developers, it can be convenient to use an `IDE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`_.
Currently, each repository can be used with:

* **Sublime Text**.
  To add a **Sublime Text** build system compatible with **StatisKit** repositories, use the following command

  .. code-block:: console

     build_system sublime_text
     
  Moreover, with **Sublime Text**, it is recommanded to use the following addons:

  * **Package Control**, see this `page <https://packagecontrol.io>` for more details.
  * **Terminal**, see this `page <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminal>` for more details.
  * **Git**, see this `page <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Git>` for more details.
  * **ProjectManager**, see this `page <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ProjectManager>` for more details.

.. note::

   Any other IDE build system proposal is welcome.
