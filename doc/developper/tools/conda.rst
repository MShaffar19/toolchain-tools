Using **Conda** for software deployment
=======================================

As stated on the **Conda** `documentation <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ ::

>> Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them.
> It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

This solution is therefore used to deploy software of the **StatisKit** organization on all systems.
For more information refers to the official documentation.

.. note::

  For now we recommand to install the Miniconda2 version.
