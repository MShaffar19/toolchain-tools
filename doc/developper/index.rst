Development of a **StatisKit** repository must  be done using a Version Control System (VCS).
for now, only **Git** VCS is officially supported (see :doc:`git`).
This development can be done in two ways:

* The **public** way, that is done using **GitHub** (see :doc:`public/index` section).
* The **private** way, that is done various services that enable private development (see :doc:`private/index` section).
