To use the **StatisKit** software suite, you need to activate the environment created during the installation of the choosen interface.
For instance, if you choosed the *Python* interface, you should type:

* For Windows OSes,

  .. code-block:: console
  
    activate python-statiskit
    
* For Unix Oses,

  .. code-block:: console
  
    source activate python-statiskit

  For the *Python* interface, the **StatisKit** software suite can be used as usual for *Python* packages as *Python* scripts that need to be executed, in the *Python* or **IPython** console or from within **Jupyter** notebooks.
  
.. warning::

  Replace :code:`python-statiskit` by the appropriate environment.
